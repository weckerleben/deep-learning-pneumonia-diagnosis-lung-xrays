- Train Loss (loss in the training set): Values decrease as epochs progress, indicating that the model is effectively learning the patterns in the training data.

- Valid Loss (loss in the validation set): Values vary across epochs, but in general remain relatively low. However, an increase in loss is observed in the third epoch, suggesting a possible fluctuation in model performance at that point.

- Accuracy: The model achieves high accuracy in all epochs, even reaching 100% in the fifth epoch. This indicates that the model is correctly classifying the vast majority of images in the validation set.

- Error Rate: Values are low in all epochs, confirming the high performance of the model in classifying images.

- Precision Score, Recall Score and F1 Score: These metrics evaluate the model's ability to classify classes in a balanced manner. In general, high and consistent values are observed, indicating good classification accuracy and completeness.

Overall, the results of the latest training are quite promising. The model shows robust performance with high accuracy and low error rates in image classification. However, it is important to take into account the fluctuation in loss in the third epoch and evaluate whether the model performance can be improved by further adjustments.
